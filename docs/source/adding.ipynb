    "Often you might want to subtract datasets from each other. This is potentially made complicated as datasets can take different forms. For example, you might want to subtract a dataset which contains annual means from a dataset that contains monthly values. In this case you want to subtract the annual mean from the relevant month in each year. To deal with this problem, nctoolkit offers the methods `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide`, which from nctoolkit v0.4.0 onwards can automatically work out the relevant method required for the dataset given.
