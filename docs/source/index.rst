Core abilities include:

   - Cropping to geographic regions
   - Interactive plotting of data
   - Subsetting to specific time periods
   - Calculating time averages
   - Calculating spatial averages
   - Calculating rolling averages
   - Calculating climatologies
   - Creating new variables using arithmetic operations
   - Calculating anomalies
   - Horizontally and vertically remapping data
   - Calculating the correlations between variables
   - Calculating vertical averages for the likes of oceanic data
   - Calculating ensemble averages
   - Calculating phenological metrics

nctoolkit is developed as open source software by the Marine Systems Modelling group at `Plymouth Marine Laboratory. <https://www.pml.ac.uk/science/Marine-Systems-Modelling/>`__
