nctoolkit: tools to manipulate and analyze NetCDF data in Python
=======================================================

nctoolkit is a Python package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for manipulating, analyzing and visualizing NetCDF data. 

The package is designed with two uses in mind: computationally intensive data post-processing and interactive Jupyter notebook type analysis. An auto plotting feature is provided to aid rapid data analysis.

Under the hood nctoolkit relies on Climate Data Operates (CDO). nctoolkit is designed as a standalone package with no required understanding of CDO, but it provides expert users of CDO the ability to process data in Python with ease, and with method chaining handled automatically.

In addition to the guidance given here, tutorials for how to use nctoolkit are available at nctoolkit's `GitHub page. <https://github.com/r4ecology/nctoolkit/tree/master/tutorials>`__
